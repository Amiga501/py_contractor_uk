# py_contractor_uk

The original aim of this project (named as py_efficient_payer) was to determine the most efficient means of working, PAYE or contractor and how to best utilise earnings.

However, acknowledging that in the future it may be expanded to more than that, it has been renamed to py_contractor_uk. Examples of possible future functionality include:
* Invoicing
* VAT payments
* Annual accounts generation
* Self assessment
